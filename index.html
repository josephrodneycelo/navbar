            <div class="home_text">Welcome to my <br> Portfolio Website</div>
 <!----------------------ABOUT ME------------------------->
<div class="me">20 years old currently studying Bachelor of Science and Information Technology, at pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig.
  I'm amazed how others create a website so this project makes me enjoy and at the same time practice my skills on creating a website. <br><br> I love to help the people in need and I promise to myself when I became successfull I will help as much as people as possible. My goal is to be successful and after that my life is contented.</div>

  <!----------------------FUTURE JOB------------------------->
  <div class="job">After I graduate in college I see myself as website developer. My interest on building a website start when I was on Senior High School where I take ICT strand. The Teacher gave us a project where we need to create a portfolio website just like now but on that situation I Don't have an idea on how to create a website because my teacher did not teach it to us. What I did is to research and watch some tutorial on youtube to help me create a website and luckily I create my own website. <br><br> Creating a website for me is fun but also stressful at the same time because of having a difficult time on how to move a single text not realising that there is 1 missing variable that I don't see. Website also challenge me on how to be creative because that is one of my weakneses, I'm not that good in art and design so I have a difficult time thinking a design for my website but thanks to the help of youtube and other site that give me ideas about designing. <br> <br>I see myself as an website developer in the future and I will keep to improve my skills not just in this field but to get out to my comfort zone to improve more my skills to have a choice on work and also for the company to hire me.</div>
